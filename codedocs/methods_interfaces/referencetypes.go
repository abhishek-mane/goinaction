// Reference types in Go are the set of slice, map, channel, interface, and function types
// When you declare a variable from one of these types, the value thatâ€™s created is called a header values.
// Technically, a string is also a reference type value. All the different header values
// from the different reference types contain a pointer to an underlying data structure.
// Each reference type also contains a set of unique fields that are used to manage the underlying data structure.
// You never share reference type values because the header value is designed to be copied.
// The header value contains a pointer; therefore, you can pass a copy of any reference type value and share the underlying data structure intrinsically.

// Code snippet shows a type called IP which is declared as a slice of bytes.
// Declaring a type like this is useful when you want to declare behavior around a built-in or reference type
